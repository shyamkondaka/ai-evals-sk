## 1. Product Strategy, The Context

**Target user:** VP-level Strategists and Product Leaders at Fortune 500 companies who pay a premium for verified market intelligence.

**Key use case:** Rapidly extracting specific, verified insights (e.g., comparing competitor pricing models or summarizing G2 reviews) without manual data digging.

**Value proposition:** Personalized, instant answers based on verified data, dramatically reducing the time spent finding and synthesizing information for high-stakes decisions and strategic roadmaps.

## 2. Measurements, The Execution

**User promise.** For VP-level Enterprise Strategists, Ascend IQ promises to deliver verified, citation-backed competitive intelligence in under 5 seconds so that they hit their Q4 roadmap milestones without manual data digging.

**Top 3 trust metrics:**
- **Latency**, Response speed (P95 / P99). Slow kills engagement.
- **Hallucination Rate**, % of outputs that are confidently false or fabricated.
- **Fairness**, Quality consistency across user groups, geos, languages.

**Why these three:** • Hallucination, VP-level clients pay $50k+ for verified data; one fabricated stat ends the contract.
• Latency, <5s response is the only thing that beats manual digging.
• Fairness, consistent factual quality across English, German & French underpins our European Enterprise expansion.

## 3. Strategic Trade-Offs, The Cost

### Trade-off 1 · Hallucination Rate ↔ Latency
We prioritize Hallucination Rate over Latency because Ascend IQ serves VPs making $1M+ strategic decisions; a single fabricated competitor stat ends a $50k contract, whereas a 3-second wait is the cost of doing business at Enterprise-grade integrity.

### Trade-off 2 · Fairness ↔ Hallucination Rate
We prioritize Fairness over peak Hallucination Rate because our European Enterprise expansion depends on consistent factual quality across English, German, and French, a slightly lower top-end score on English is acceptable for a 3x larger TAM.
